# Creating a release

Step-by-step guide on creating a Xenon release

## 1. Up the version number and add changelog

To create a release, version numbers should be updated in:

- README.md
- gradle/common.gradle
- CHANGELOG.md

    Also, add a section to the CHANGELOG.md with notable changes in this version.

- CITATION.cff (see section below)

## 2. Update the site

To update Xenon version in `docs/_data/version.yml` and update Javadocs inside `docs/` directory run:

```bash
./gradlew publishSite
```

The site is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) powered site and hosted by GitHub pages at http://nlesc.github.io/Xenon/

## 2.1 Update the CITATION.cff and generate the Zenodo metadata

The ``CITATION.cff`` contains the information on how to cite Xenon in scientific
applications. Update the authors list if needed, and change the
``date-released`` and ``version`` fields to reflect the release that you are
about to make.

NOTE: the CITATION.cff contains the concept DOI of xenon (refering to all versions), so this does not need to be changed. 

After updating the citation metadata, use [``cffconvert``](https://pypi.org/project/cffconvert/)
to generate the metadata as used by Zenodo. Install ``cffconvert`` as follows:

```bash
# install cffconvert in user space from PyPI
pip3 install --user cffconvert

# change directory to xenon root dir (if needed)
cd <directory where the CITATION.cff lives>

# check if the CITATION.cff file is valid (if there is no output, that 
# means it's all good)
cffconvert --validate

# generate the zenodo file by (note the dot in the file name):
cffconvert --outputformat zenodo --ignore-suspect-keys > .zenodo.json
```


## 3. Commit the changes

Next, commit all changes you have made to the master branch. If you check with  

    git status

you should get something like this:

    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Changes not staged for commit:

	modified:   .zenodo.json
	modified:   CITATION.cff
	modified:   CHANGELOG.md
	modified:   README.md
	modified:   gradle/common.gradle
    modified:   docs/_config.yml

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	docs/versions/3.0.1/

Add and commit these files using `git add` and `git commit` and `git push`.

## 4. Create a GitHub release

On GitHub, go to the releases tab and draft a new release.

The tag and title should be set to the version.

The release description should contain a small text to explain what Xenon is and the part of the CHANGELOG.md which pertains to this version.

## 5. Check if DOI is created in Zenodo

Zenodo is linked to the Xenon github, so when a release is created, a DOI 
will be created automatically. Click the DOI badge on the github page to check 
this.

Check that the authors and license of the Zenodo entry are correct.
If not, then correct, save and publish the Zenodo entry.

### 6. Add jars to bintray

To add the release to bintray, do the following: 

```bash
export BINTRAY_USER=<your bintray username>
export BINTRAY_KEY=<your bintray API key>
./gradlew publishToBintray
```

This should create the new release on bintray and upload all necessary data, jars, etc.

On https://bintray.com/nlesc/xenon check that xenon* packages have been updated.

The latest version tag usually takes a few minutes to update.

### Alternative manual bintray step

Note: this step should not be needed if the automated bintray publishing works! It is only here for reference.

To add the necessary jar and pom files to bintray manually, it is easiest to ensure you 
have them locally first. By calling: 

    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

gradle should put the required files in:

    ~/.m2/repository/nl/esciencecenter/xenon/xenon/<version>/

Next goto: 

    https://bintray.com/nlesc/xenon/xenon

Click on 'new version' and insert <version> as name. Next, in the overview page 
click on the version number and on `UI` (in the version files box). Bintray will 
ask for the 'Target Repository Path', which should be: 

    /nl/esciencecenter/xenon/xenon/<version>

Click on the `click to add files` button and add the files that where generated in 
the .m2 repository. Click on `save` and then on `publish` to publish the version.
 
### 7. Update applications using Xenon.

Update related repos such as Xenon-examples, pyXenon, xenon-cli, etc

And finally celebrate.
